# Key Requirement/Eligibility to Enter Applications
* Graduate students (masters and PhD) currently enrolled and engaged in research in biology,
  chemistry, computer science and other related fields are eligible to apply.
* Early career scientists, such as post-docs and staff scientists are eligible to apply. We
  consider an early career role to be one held within 5 years of receiving the highest relevant
  qualification in the fields of biology, chemistry, computer science and other closely related
  fields. Career disruptions, such as pregnancy and major illness/injury can be deducted from the
  5-year cutoff.
* Applicants are expected to have at least a beginner knowledge in any programming
  language.
  
**Application material:**
1. Applicant must choose one potential host lab to apply to:

   1. Dr. Laurent Gatto (De Duve Institute UCLouvain, Belgium)
   The lab is interested in statistical learning, high throughput biological data, and a notable focus
   on single-cell proteomics. The lab actively contribute to the Bioconductor project and prefers R
   programming language but open to other languages including Python, Rust, Julia or C/C++.
   
      For more information, visit: https://lgatto.github.io/cbio-lab/
   
   2. Dr. Mathias Wilhelm (Technical University of Munich, Germany)
   The lab is interested in deep learning, computational proteomics and big data analysis. The
   preferred programming language is Python.
      
      For more information, visit https://www.mls.ls.tum.de/en/compms/home/

   3. Dr. Viktoria Dorfer (University of Applied Sciences Upper Austria, Austria)
   The lab focuses on the development of algorithms for peptide identification in
   bottom-up mass spectrometry data. The preferred programming language is C#
   and Python.
   
      For more information, visit: https://protrein.eu/supervisor/viktoria-dorfer/ and https://bioinformatics.fh-hagenberg.at
2. Describe your research motivation and how it aligns with the host lab you have selected
   (150 words max).
3. How have you and/or will you contribute to advocating and uplifting underrepresented
   groups in the field of computational mass spectrometry (100 words max).
4. Name one individual to submit a recommendation letter on your behalf. The individual could
   be your research advisor, a professor, an employer or anyone that can speak about your
   character and research contributions. The individual will receive an email asking them to
   upload a letter and will receive a confirmation email after we receive it.

If you have questions — please email us at edi@openms.org

# Payment of Award
   The payment of the award to the recipient will be processed through the University of Toronto.
   The recipient is expected to sign a letter confirming their acceptance of the award and an
   attestation form indicating that the funds have been received. The recipient will have the choice
   of receiving funds via wire transfer or by cheque.

# Sponsors
   The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative was founded in 2015 to help solve some of society’s toughest
   challenges — from eradicating disease and improving education, to addressing needs for our
   local communities. Our mission is to build a more inclusive, just, and healthy future for
   everyone.
   OpenMS offers an open-source C++ library (+ Python binding) for LC-MS data management,
   analysis, and visualization. It empowers rapid development of mass spectrometry related
   software. OpenMS is freely available under the three clause BSD license and runs under
   Windows, MacOS and Linux. The OpenMS members have a strong commitment to creating an
   open, inclusive, and positive community in the computational mass spectrometry field.

# Supporting Society
   Females in Mass Spectrometry (FeMS) is a community-led initiative to create a network of
   support for women in the field of mass spectrometry. Our goal is to bring together, encourage,
   empower and facilitate viability of women in mass spectrometry - and to create connectivity
   between all members of the mass spectrometry community.
   We strive to engage our entire community: women in mass spectrometry and their supporters -
   to hear and learn from all perspectives. As a global initiative FeMS support all related events
   where women working the MS field gather.
